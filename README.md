# Tailored-Jewelry-App
One of my first apps made for a friend for her jewelry business.

Includes an option to select featured products on the main screen
Selecting a product takes you to a new Viewcontroller where the user can zoom in and out for more detail as well as select additional pictures.
User has an option to like certain products which will be saved in a filtered array that can be viewed on the main Viewcontroller.
Adding to cart and filling out the form submits an email to the owner to contact the person requesting additional info.

ADDITIONAL & IMPORTANT Information below:

App makes use of https://www.mailgun.com and the CocoaPod https://github.com/PiXeL16/SwiftMailgun to incorporate into project to send user data to the owner of the company.

App was original built during Fall 2016 as one of my very first projects outside of a run of the mill weather app.  Because of this, architecture is NOT an effective representation of the MVC model.  Additionally, there is an over-abundance of the use of frames for animation purposes as opposed to using Autolayout and resetting the subviews.

App will be updated, refined, setup for actual purchases, and published to the appstore once the owner decides to activate the app.
